You have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer n and a list of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Certainly! Let's walk through the code step by step using Example 1:

Example 1:

Input:

python
Copy code
n1 = 5
edges1 = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]
Step 1: Check if the number of edges is equal to n - 1 (Condition 1). In this case, n is 5, and there are 4 edges, so the condition holds true.

Step 2: Create an adjacency list to represent the graph. Initialize an empty list for each node.

css
Copy code
adjacency_list = [[], [], [], [], []]
Iterate through the edges and add the vertices to the adjacency list:

Edge [0, 1]: Add 1 as a neighbor of 0 and 0 as a neighbor of 1 (undirected edge).
Edge [0, 2]: Add 2 as a neighbor of 0 and 0 as a neighbor of 2.
Edge [0, 3]: Add 3 as a neighbor of 0 and 0 as a neighbor of 3.
Edge [1, 4]: Add 4 as a neighbor of 1 and 1 as a neighbor of 4.
Now, adjacency_list looks like this:

css
Copy code
adjacency_list = [[1, 2, 3], [0, 4], [0], [0], [1]]
Step 3: Initialize an empty set called visited to keep track of visited nodes during traversal.

scss
Copy code
visited = set()
Initialize a stack with the starting node, which is 0.

arduino
Copy code
stack = [0]
Step 4: Perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph:

Pop 0 from the stack and mark it as visited. visited = {0}

Add its unvisited neighbors (1, 2, 3) to the stack for further exploration. stack = [1, 2, 3]

Pop 3 from the stack and mark it as visited. visited = {0, 3}

Continue exploring its neighbors, but there are none, so the stack remains [1, 2].

Pop 2 from the stack and mark it as visited. visited = {0, 3, 2}

Continue exploring its neighbors, but there are none, so the stack remains [1].

Pop 1 from the stack and mark it as visited. visited = {0, 3, 2, 1}

Add its unvisited neighbor 4 to the stack. stack = [4]

Pop 4 from the stack and mark it as visited. visited = {0, 3, 2, 1, 4}

There are no more unvisited neighbors.

Step 5: After traversal, check if the number of visited nodes is equal to n (Condition 2). In this case, n is 5, and visited contains all nodes ({0, 1, 2, 3, 4}). Therefore, the graph is connected.

Step 6: Return True because the conditions for a valid tree are met.

Final Output:

graphql
Copy code
True
So, the given edges in Example 1 form a valid tree.
